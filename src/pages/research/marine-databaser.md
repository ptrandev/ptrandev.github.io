Work in progress. An Electron application that allows marine biology researchers to categorize and analyze video, audio, and other files collected in the field entirely on device. This program includes functions for quickly splicing videos for analysis, extracting audio from videos, and a database for storing and categorizing files. This project is being completed under the supervision of Professor Phillip Lobel, professor of marine biology at Boston University.
